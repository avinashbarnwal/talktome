# Machine learning lie detector

## Setup

I will not publish the values of the parameters needed to run this code because these values are sort of subjectives
and because keeping them for myself will keep me a little ahead (presumably. Instead, I will publish the empty configuration file: [locals.cfg.template](./talktome/locals.cfg.template).

## Thoughts log:

* Download you tubes "interviews" of all kinds
* Extract audio
* Heuristic way to select audios without background music
* Extract from audio short segments, that is, words or voice sounds
* Extract features from segments
* Normalize
* Make clusters
* Decision point

Comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
