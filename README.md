# Machine learning lie detector

## Motivation

Ideally, you would not need an instrument able to tell you if someone is lying or not, or how he/she is feeling.
Instead, you would want to give them the freedom to be the only judges of their behavior.
However, in practice, today's fast and impersonal way of living allows people to get by with being dishonest or superficial in their relationship with others.
Moreover, soul-less entities like business, government, and collective consciousness in general should and will always do their best to maximize their success,
including misleading and lying to you if necessary. This is part of the game and that's OK to play it.
One countermeasure to the above situation is having an instrument able to help you figuring out who/what the other side is about.
No instrument will be 100% correct and way to elude it are always possible, thus there is no reason to be afraid of transforming everybody into machines.

## Setup

I will not publish the values of the parameters needed to run this code because these values are sort of subjectives
and because keeping them for myself will keep me a little ahead (presumably. Instead, I will publish the empty configuration file: [locals.cfg.template](./talktome/locals.cfg.template).

## Thoughts log:

* Download you tubes "interviews" of all kinds
* Extract audio
* Heuristic way to select audios without background music
* Extract from audio short segments, that is, words or voice sounds
* Extract features from segments
* Normalize
* Make clusters
* Decision point
